1- I've done these projects by just watching videos or reading some parts of the books. <br/>
But over time and with more learning and gaining more experience through my work I discovered or learned ways and better solutions. <br/>

2- Some of the projects is developed by me and others i only read the code and the run the code.<br/>
3- Watch The Projects In The Run Time In My Playlist in Youtube : <br/>
